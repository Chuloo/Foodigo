This is a realtime food ordering app using USSD. Realtime in that the user receives requests as soon as it is made to the server via USSD. 

Africa's Talking, Pusher and Vue are used to build this app.

Create an account on [pusher](pusher.com) and [Africa's Talking](africastalking.com) to obtain app credentials and a USSD channel.

After account setup, create a file cred.js in the root directory. Fill in the credentials as seen in the cred_sample.js file. To create a local development server, run

```js
npm run serve
```

This is still WIP...
